	    			<!-- End Eligibility -->

	    			<!-- Begin Services -->
	    			<h3>The Blockchain Services</h3>
	    			<p>
	    				Lunagram is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive cryptographically secured tokens such as the Atom (the “Virtual Currency”); (b) allows users to browse third party decentralized applications (“DApps” or “DApp”) through the mobile application (including internal browser, Telegram Bots, and Telegram messages); (c) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to blockchains; and (d) Provide a Telegram interface intermediary to facilitate blockchain transactions.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities.</em>
		    			An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any seed (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet address, seed phrase (mnemonic phrase), and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Lunagram Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval.</em>
		    			We do not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or seed phrase (mnemonic phrase) associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Virtual Currency Transactions.</em>
		    			In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchains  and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Lunagram, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Cosmos Hub (or any other blockchains supported by Lunagram).  
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Lunagram Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency.</em>
		    			We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Cosmos-SDK  based blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Lunagram can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Accuracy of Information Provided by User.</em>
		    			You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency.
		    		</p>
		    		<!-- End Services -->

		    		<!-- Begin Wallet Registration -->
	    			<h3>Wallet Registration and Account Information</h3>
	    			<p>
	    				You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Lunagram. When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key (seed phrase). You will be prompted to write down the seed phrase and safely store it	. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and keystore, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security.
		    			<br><br>
		    			We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet.  Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b) Safeguard your private key and seed phrase (mnemonic phrase) on an offline external hard drive or physical note stored in a safe place (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and seed phrase (mnemonic phrase) associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Push Notifications and Telegram Messages.</em>
		    			You may agree to receive push notifications and Telegram messages from Lunagram that will alert you when the Cosmos-SDK based blockchains are congested and when transactions involving your Wallet have been completed.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Payment and Fees.</em>
		    			Lunagram does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Transactions.</em>
		    			Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. Lunagram has no control over any Cosmos-based blockchain and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Lunagram account.
		    			<br><br>
		    			<em>Taxes.</em>
		    			It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Cosmos-based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related transactions.

		    		<!-- End Services -->

		    		<!-- Begin Third Party -->
	    			<h3>Third Party Services and Content</h3>
	    			<p>
	    				In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties and explore DApps by using Lunagram’s internal browser, Telegram messaging interface, or Telegram Bot platform (the “Third Party Services”). We have no control over the content and policies of these Third Party Services (the “Third Party Content”) and, in no event, shall we be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, reliability, or currentness of any third party’s content or policies. Users who conduct transactions or take part in other activities through the Third Party Services do so at their own risk and we shall not be held responsible or liable for the Third Party Services’ compliance with state or federal laws and regulations. Users who access or use a Third Party Service through Lunagram are also solely responsible for complying with the terms and policies of these third parties.
		    			<br><br>
		    			In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service. You may agree to receive push notifications and Telegram messages from Third Party Content providers. We do not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content shared through push notifications, and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, but not limited to, token availability and/or sales.
		    			<br><br>
		    			If, to the extent permitted by Lunagram, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Lunagram account, either through the third party’s product or service or through Lunagram, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your Lunagram account.
		    		</p>
